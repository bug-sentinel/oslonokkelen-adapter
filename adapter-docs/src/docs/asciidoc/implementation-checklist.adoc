= Implementation checklist

List of things you must remember when implementing an adapter. We appreciate a heads up if you find anything is missing
from this list.

== HTTP endpoints

Your adapter must implement the following http endpoints. You can choose your own `<path>`, but it must be the same
for all endpoints. Details can be found on the page describing the xref:protocol.adoc[protocol] and xref:protobuf.adoc[message format].

* [ ] Expose endpoints on port 443 with a valid tls certificate
* [ ] Parsing won't fail on unknown fields in token (forward compatiblity)
* [ ] Manifest: `GET <path>/manifest`
* [ ] Execute: `GET <path>/execute`


== Authentication

Please note that this will never be an exhaustive list. The details can be found on the page describing
link:authentication.adoc[authentication]. You will get a lot of these "for free" if you are able to use our Kotlin SDK.

* [ ] Fetch https://api.prod.citykey.oslo.systems/adapter/v2/keys[public keys] from Oslonøkkelen backend
* [ ] Cache public keys by `kid` for at least 24 hours
* [ ] Make sure your http client verifies tls certificate when fetching public keys
* [ ] Validate token signature against cached public keys
* [ ] Only accept tokens signed with an approved algorithm
* [ ] Use `jti` to guard against token replays
* [ ] Use `exp` to ensure you don't accept expired tokens
* [ ] Use `aud` to ensure the token is intended for your adapter
* [ ] Use `iss` to verify that the token originates from the expected environment


== Registering your adapter

After implementing everything described above, you can get in touch with us with the following information:

* [ ] Your adapters public uri like `https://dev.example.com/api/oslonokkelen`
* [ ] At least one email address for alerts if something fails
* [ ] "Behandlingsgrunnlag" for any actions requiring personal data (GDPR)

== Other requirements

* [ ] Your adapter must have a way to filter which doors are made available to Oslonøkkelen.
